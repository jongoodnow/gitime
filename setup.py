Keep track of your billable hours along with your commits. Gitime lets you build an invoice with your tasks and hours worked from your commit messages.

`Read the docs <http://gitime.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ for more details

Simple Usage
------------

Set your hourly rate::

    $ gitime set -r 50

Start a new invoice::

    $ gitime invoice -n "Awesome Secret Project"

Time how long you've been working::

    $ gitime timer start

Make a commit as you would normally, but on the commit step, use :code:`gitime` instead of :code:`git`::

    $ git add feature.c
    $ gitime commit -m "Added a really cool thing"
    $ git push

Or, if you don't like timers, record the time yourself with the :code:`--hours` flag::

    $ gitime commit -m "Proved Riemann Hypothesis" --hours 2

Look at your invoice::

    $ gitime status
    On invoice Awesome Secret Project
    Total time worked: 3 hours
    Total charges:     $150.00
    Charges:
    07-21-2014         1 hour          Added a really cool thing
    07-22-2014         2 hours         Proved Riemann Hypothesis

When it's time to bill, export your invoice to a spreadsheet. Currently, the only format available is csv. More formats are coming soon::

    $ gitime export

Installation
------------

You'll need two things installed to use gitime:

- `Git <http://git-scm.com/downloads>`_, and an executable called :code:`git` on your path
- `Python 2.7 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ (or Python 3.4)

Install the latest release with::

    $ pip install gitime

Or install the development version with::

    $ git clone https://github.com/jongoodnow/gitime.git
    $ cd gitime
    $ python setup.py install
